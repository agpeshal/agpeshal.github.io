I am a Machine Learning engineer at [Pallon](http://www.pallon.com) (a ETH AI startup) responsible for building computer vision models to identify defects inside sewers. I earned my masters in Statistics with a focus on AI from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). I completed my masters thesis in [Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) under the supervision of [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH.

Before moving to Switzerland, I did my bachelors and masters in Mathamatics and Scientific Computing from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in India where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Debasis Kundu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yq8z1rIAAAAJ&hl=en).

I had the privilege to intern at IBM Research and Goldman Sachs during my studies.
